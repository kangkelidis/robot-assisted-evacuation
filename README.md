# A Simulation Toolkit for Evaluating Human-Robot Collaboration in Emergency Evacuations

This project is a Docker-based application that facilitates experimentation with the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3654439" target="_blank">`IMPACT+` agent-based evacuation simulation model</a>. Developed with NetLogo,`IMPACT+` is an extension of <a href="https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/122415/1/van%20der%20Wal%20et%20al.%20(2017)%20[TCCI].pdf" target="_black">`IMPACT`</a>, which simulates an evacuation from a transport hub and incorporates sociocultural, cognitive, and emotional factors. 

The key addition of `IMPACT+` is the introduction of an adaptable search and rescue (SAR) robot that is able to decide, when it finds a fallen victim, whether to ask help from a nearby zero-responder (another passenger) or from a first-responder (member of staff). The SAR robot bases its decision on the zero-responders' social identity, ie. the likelihood that they will accept to offer help. Assuming that first-responders are scarce, getting help from a zero-responder can lead to faster evacuation times.

This tool aims to make it easier for researchers to configure, run and analyse simulations with various evacuation scenarios and adaptation strategies for the SAR robot.

## Usage

To start the application, ensure that you are at the parent directory and run:
```bash
./run-container.sh
```
> **_NOTE:_**
>Make sure you use the `chmod +x` command to add execute permissions to the file and avoid the "permission denied" error.

> **_NOTE:_** Make sure docker engine is running

If you downloaded the image from Docker Hub instead of building it locally, add `hub` after the script name. For example:
```bash
./run-container.sh hub
```

To only analyse the results of an experiment saved in a folder use:
```bash
./run-container.sh [hub] --analyse FOLDER
``` 
Replace FOLDER with the folder name, located in the results directory.
<br>

If you modify any part of the code you might need to rebuild the docker image before running it, run:
```bash
./build-docker-image.sh
```
or just run:
```bash
./build-and-run.sh
```

<br>

The application will set up the simulations based on the configurations provided and then begin running the simulations in parallel. A progress bar will display the status and an estimate time to complete all simulations. Depending on the number of simulations, parameter values and hardware resources available, the simulations may take significant amount of time to complete. Running 100 simulations with the default configuration on a 14-cores CPU should take less than 5 minutes to complete.

### Results

The application generates a `results` folder in the `workspace` directory, to store the output of the simulations. Each experiment's results are stored in a subfolder named using a timestamp. This subfolder contains the following:

1. **Data Folder**: Contains CSV files with detailed results and metrics:
    - `experiment_data.csv`: Contains all the results and information for each simulation.
    - `scenario_metrics.csv`: Contains the metrics for each scenario.
    - `scenario_processed_data.csv`: Contains the evacuation time per scenario.
    - `strategy_metrics.csv`: Contains the metrics for each strategy.
    - `strategy_processed_data.csv`: Contains the evacuation time per strategy.

2. **Img Folder**: Contains various plots:
    - Violin plots for each scenario.
    - Violin plots for each strategy.
    - Robots actions plot.
    - Plots for each pair of parameter combinations against the evacuation time.

3. **Video Folder**: Contains any videos created during the simulations.

4. **Config File**: `config.json` contains the configurations used to create the experiment.

5. **Hypothesis Test File**: `hypothesis_test.txt` contains the results of the statistical analysis.

if you need to delete all the results folders run:
```bash
./clear-results.sh
```

#### Examples
The `examples` folder contains several example simulation experiments that demonstrate the capabilities of the tool.

### Combining Parameters

The application has the ability to use lists and ranges to create combinations of parameters. It will automatically generate all possible combinations of the provided parameters and run `num_of_samples` simulations for each combination.

For example, given the following configuration:
```json
"numOfStaff": [2, 10],

"fallChance": {
    "start": 0.05,
    "end": 1,
    "step": 0.1
},
"num_of_samples": 5
```
The program will create combinations of numOfStaff and fallChance values, and for each combination, it will run 5 simulations.
- numOfStaff = 2 and fallChance = 0.05
- numOfStaff = 2 and fallChance = 0.15
- ...
- numOfStaff = 10 and fallChance = 0.95

For each of these combinations, the program will run the specified number of simulations (`num_of_samples`). For each combination pair, a plot will be generated comparing the impact on evacuation time.

There are 8 different room types that the evacuation simulation can use.
The PNGs for the rooms are located in `workspace/netlogo/rooms`

| Type | Filename                                         |

## Strategies

The application includes basic predefined strategies for the SAR robot. Each strategy defines the robot's action when encountering a fallen victim:
- **`RandomStrategy.py`**: Randomly chooses between asking for help from a passenger or calling for staff assistance.
- **`HelpMatrixStrategy.py`**: A baseline strategy, uses the help matrix from the IMPACT+ model to predict if a zero responder will accept to offer help.
- **`AlwaysCallStaffStrategy.py`**: Always calls for a staff member to assist the victim.
- **`AlwaysAskHelpStrategy.py`**: Always asks for help from a passenger.

Each strategy is defined in a python file saved in the `strategies` folder and inherits from the `AdaptationStrategy` base class in `adaptation_strategy.py` file.

### Creating New Strategies

To create a new strategy, follow these steps:

1. **Create a New Python File**: In the strategies folder, create a new Python file. The name of the file (minus the .py extension) will be the name of the strategy. For example, if you want to create a strategy named `NewStrategy`, create a file named `NewStrategy.py` in the strategies folder.

2. **Import the Base Class**: In your new strategy file, import the `AdaptationStrategy` base class from `adaptation_strategy.py`.
```python
from src.adaptation_strategy import AdaptationStrategy, Survivor
```
3. **Define the Strategy Class**: Create a new class with exactly the same name as the strategy and file name. This class should inherit from `AdaptationStrategy`.
```python
class NewStrategy(AdaptationStrategy):
    def get_robot_action(self,
                         simulation_id: str,
                         candidate_helper: Survivor,
                         victim: Survivor,
                         helper_victim_distance: float,
                         first_responder_victim_distance: float) -> str:
        # Implement the logic for the strategy here
        pass
```
4. **Implement the get_robot_action Method**: The `get_robot_action` method should contain the logic for how the robots will behave during the evacuation. This method will be called each time the robot encounters a fallen victim and must decide between asking for help from a nearby zero responder or a member of staff.
```python
def get_robot_action(self,
                     simulation_id: str,
                     candidate_helper: Survivor,
                     victim: Survivor,
                     helper_victim_distance: float,
                     first_responder_victim_distance: float) -> str:
    # Example logic for the new strategy
    if helper_victim_distance < first_responder_victim_distance:
        return self.ASK_FOR_HELP_ROBOT_ACTION
    else:
        return self.CALL_STAFF_ROBOT_ACTION
```
5. **Using the Strategy**: To use a strategy, simply specify the name of the strategy in the `adaptationStrategy` field of a scenario in the `config.json` file:
```json
{
    "name": "new-strategy",
    "description": "A new Strategy.",
    "adaptationStrategy": "NewStrategy",
    "enabled": true
}
```
